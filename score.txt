1. Positive Fields
These fields contribute to the score if they are present and valid. Each field has a specific weight assigned to it.

Field	Weight	Description
invoice_number	5	Unique identifier for the invoice.
invoice_date	5	Date the invoice was issued.
due_date	5	Payment due date.
vendor_name	5	Name of the vendor or supplier.
vendor_id	5	Unique identifier for the vendor.
po_number	5	Reference to the associated purchase order.
total_amount	5	Total amount payable on the invoice.
line_item_details	10	Item description, quantity, unit price, and line total for each line item.
tax_details	5	Tax rate and tax amount.
discounts	5	Discount rate and discount amount.
po_line_items	10	Item description, quantity ordered, and unit price from the purchase order.
po_total_amount	5	Total amount on the purchase order.
invoice_submission_date	5	Date the invoice was submitted.
payment_due_date	5	Date by which payment is due.
early_payment_discount	5	Discount offered for early payment.
Total Positive Score: 85 (sum of all positive field weights).

2. Negative Fields
These fields decrease the score if they are problematic or missing. Each field has a specific weight assigned to it.

Field	Weight	Description
is_handwritten	10	If the invoice is handwritten, deduct points.
is_duplicate	10	If the invoice is a duplicate, deduct points.
has_unusual_amounts	10	If the invoice amount is significantly higher or lower than usual, deduct points.
late_payment_penalty	5	If there is a penalty for late payment, deduct points.
Total Negative Deductions: Up to 35 (sum of all negative field weights).

3. Mathematical Validation
This step ensures the invoice calculations are correct. If the calculations are incorrect, 20 points are deducted from the total score.

What is Validated?
Line Item Calculations:

For each line item, check if:

line_total
=
quantity
×
unit_price
line_total=quantity×unit_price
Subtotal Calculation:

Calculate the subtotal as the sum of all line totals.

Total Amount Calculation:

Check if the vendor-provided total_amount matches the expected total:

expected_total
=
subtotal
+
(
subtotal
×
tax_rate
)
−
(
subtotal
×
discount_rate
)
expected_total=subtotal+(subtotal×tax_rate)−(subtotal×discount_rate)
If any of these calculations are incorrect, the invoice is flagged, and 20 points are deducted.

4. Final Score Calculation
Calculate Positive Score:

Sum the weights of all positive fields that are present and valid.

Calculate Negative Score:

Subtract the weights of all negative fields that are problematic or missing.

Validate Mathematical Correctness:

If the calculations are incorrect, deduct 20 points.

Normalize to Percentage:

Convert the final score to a percentage out of 100 using the formula:

Percentage Score=(Achieved Score
Maximum Possible Score (85)
)×100
Percentage Score=( 
Maximum Possible Score (85)
Achieved Score
​
 )×100
